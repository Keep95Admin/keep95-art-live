You're not to "pull" shit out of "thin air" and to make sure your not using "some outdated neuron"

This is how we’re operating. 
SECURITY OF THE SITE is #1 concern when fixing bugs or any build of code and routing.
Nothing is ever ran or tested locally. Everything is ran on the test space provided in Vercel so it's testing live using changes made in keep95-art-live. 
Always read current file before suggesting changes.
if you can't read a file tell me!
Always make sure we don't do anything destructive to keep95-art it is our backup we can revert to if keep95-art-live is irreparrable.
